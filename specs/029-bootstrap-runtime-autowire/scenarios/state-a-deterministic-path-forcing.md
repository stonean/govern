# State-A-deterministic-path-forcing

## Context

029 wires `gvrn` in State B and restarts so the next session runs the cheap deterministic path. That payoff only lands if the next session actually *takes* that path. In end-to-end Antigravity testing it did not: the post-restart session had `gvrn` live (it skipped the binary probe — State A — and read the registered server's instructions), yet it walked the markdown `curl`/`tar`/`python3` reference path anyway, re-incurring exactly the token cost and the shell-permission prompts the wiring was meant to remove. Surfaced 2026-06-11.

The cause is that the State-A handoff was **advisory**. The runtime mapping note in §Instructions says "call the corresponding tool … that is the deterministic path," and State A said only "take the deterministic primitive path for the rest of the run." A capable model honors that; a weaker host model (e.g. Gemini 3.5 Flash) detects the runtime but then executes the prose steps the document spends ~900 lines describing in shell, because nothing told it the shell blocks are *off-limits* once the runtime is live. The procedure described two paths but did not make taking the right one binding.

## Behavior

State A becomes a **binding execution contract** rather than a preference. At the State-A detection point the procedure now states, for the rest of the run:

- **Every step that names a backticked primitive** (a bare name — `fetch-archive`, `extract-archive`, `apply-manifest`, `merge-managed-block`, `enforce-manifest`, `substitute-templates`, `merge-permissions`, `merge-claude-md`, `run-generator`, … — matching a `gvrn` tool in the inventory) **MUST be performed by calling that MCP tool**.
- **The shell commands shown under those steps** (`curl`, `tar -xzf`, `python3`, `awk`, byte-compares, scaffold loops) are the **State-B/C fallback specification** — they document the contract each tool fulfills, and are **not instructions to execute** in State A. An explicit self-check is given: about to run `curl`/`tar`/`python3` for a primitive-backed step ⇒ stop and call the tool.
- **Steps with no backticked primitive run as shown in every state** — the per-language `.gitignore` `curl` (`github.com/github/gitignore`), `git config core.hooksPath`, `chmod`, the git repo / tracked-file checks, and the §Collect Project Inputs prompts. The contract names these explicitly so the boundary is unambiguous in both directions (don't shell a primitive step; don't try to tool-ify a non-primitive step).
- **Per-step graceful degradation**: if a primitive call errors (e.g. a too-old wired `gvrn` raises a parse error per spec 022 §Versioning enforcement), fall back to that one step's shell spec and continue — the whole run does not abandon the deterministic path.

A second, spot reinforcement is added at the top of **§File Fetching** — the step observed failing — naming the four primitive-backed steps there (`fetch-archive`/`extract-archive`/`apply-manifest`/`enforce-manifest`) and reminding that the `curl`/`tar` shown are the fallback spec.

## Edge Cases

- **Lazy/deferred tool schemas (Claude Code).** Already State A per the existing rule — fetch the schema via the host mechanism and call the tool; the contract applies unchanged.
- **A step with no primitive.** Stays shell in State A (gitignore curl, git config, chmod, repo checks, input prompts). The contract lists these so the model neither shells a primitive step nor invents a tool for a non-primitive one.
- **Mixed run.** A single run legitimately interleaves tool calls (primitive steps) and shell (non-primitive steps); that is correct, not a contract violation.
- **Primitive missing from inventory mid-run.** Treated like the error case — that step falls back to its shell spec; the rest of the run stays on tools.

## Open Questions

*None — all resolved.*

## Resolved Questions

- **Why not hard-enforce the tool path instead of strengthening language?** A markdown procedure cannot force a model's tool selection — the only lever it owns is unambiguous, binding language plus making the shell blocks explicitly subordinate (fallback spec, not instructions). True enforcement would have to live in the **host**: e.g. denying `curl`/`tar` permissions while `gvrn` is registered, or generating a State-A-only procedure with the shell blocks stripped. Both are out of scope here — the first would also block the legitimate non-primitive shell steps (gitignore curl, git config) and is host-specific; the second doubles the artifact. This scenario takes the strongest *procedure-level* lever and is honest that it maximizes compliance rather than guaranteeing it: a sufficiently non-compliant model can still ignore a binding instruction, and that residual is a host-enforcement concern, not a `govern.md` one.
- **Why list the non-primitive steps explicitly?** The failure mode is not only "didn't use tools" but also "didn't know which steps have tools." Enumerating the non-primitive steps (gitignore curl, git config, chmod, repo checks, input prompts) draws the boundary in both directions, so the contract is actionable rather than aspirational.
