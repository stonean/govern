# 022 — Deterministic Runtime Tasks

Tasks derived from the [plan](plan.md). Complete in order. Each task is small enough to complete and verify in a single session; later tasks depend on earlier ones.

## 65. Implement scenario: [mcp-arg-unknown-field-strictness](scenarios/mcp-arg-unknown-field-strictness.md)

- [ ] Implement the behavior described in `scenarios/mcp-arg-unknown-field-strictness.md`

- **Done when**: an unknown field in an MCP tool call is rejected with a naming error via a derived per-primitive field allowlist; the exec path's superset-context binding is unaffected; a test covers a misspelled kebab arg on both surfaces; `cargo test` green.
