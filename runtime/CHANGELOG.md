# Changelog

All notable changes to the `govern` deterministic runtime are recorded here. The runtime ships in lockstep with the framework per [§runtime-boundary](../framework/constitution.md#runtime-boundary); release tags use the `gvrn-v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` scheme distinct from framework tags (was `runtime-v*` before v0.2.0 — see the v0.2.0 rename entry below).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added

- Four primitives for the bootstrap procedure (scenario `022.govern-bootstrap`):
  - `fetch-archive` — download an archive plus its sha256 sidecar via reqwest's blocking client and verify the hash before persisting. Adds `reqwest` (blocking, rustls-tls) and `sha2` deps; a 256 MiB per-fetch ceiling caps memory defensively.
  - `extract-archive` — extract `.tar.gz`/`.tgz`/`.zip` in-process (no shell-out) via `flate2` + `tar` and the `zip` crate. Path-traversal protection rejects absolute paths and `..` components before writing.
  - `substitute-templates` — walk a source tree, apply `{key}` → value replacements to text files, copy binary files unchanged, write to a destination tree. Args use `source-dir` / `target-dir` (distinct from extract-archive's `dest` so both primitives can share a single procedure context).
  - `merge-claude-md` — idempotent BEGIN/END marker insert/update for a framework-managed block in CLAUDE.md. Four actions: created / inserted / updated / unchanged; unchanged preserves mtime.
- `gvrn exec` command resolution now considers `framework/bootstrap/<name>.md` as a third candidate after the existing two paths, so the `/govern` bootstrap procedure runs through the runtime.
- `framework/bootstrap/govern.md` gains a parseable `## Instructions` section that exercises the four new primitives plus a gate-confirm for the install approval; the existing 788-line procedure stays in place as the markdown-only reference.

### Changed

- **BREAKING** — package, binary, and library all renamed `runtime` / `govern_runtime` / `govern-runtime` → `gvrn`. Release tag pattern becomes `gvrn-v*` (was `runtime-v*`); release artifacts become `gvrn-<TARGET>.tar.gz` (was `runtime-<TARGET>.tar.gz`).
- **BREAKING** — `substitute-templates` argument names `source` / `dest` → `source-dir` / `target-dir` to avoid clashing with `extract-archive`'s `dest` in shared procedure context.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added

- Crate scaffold under `runtime/`: `Cargo.toml`, binary entrypoint at `src/main.rs`, library root at `src/lib.rs`, module placeholders for `parser`, `interpreter`, `primitives`, `mcp`, `schema`, and `io`.
- Lint configuration in `Cargo.toml`: `unsafe_code = "forbid"`, `missing_docs = "warn"`, clippy `all` + `pedantic` at warn, plus `unwrap_used` and `expect_used` at warn.
- Pre-commit verification (`.githooks/pre-commit`): when staged changes touch `runtime/`, the hook runs `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test`. Set `GOVERN_SKIP_RUNTIME_CHECKS=1` to bypass for a single commit.
- `runtime/bacon.toml` — `bacon` job definitions (`check`, `clippy`, `test`, `fmt`) with `clippy` as the default. Install with `cargo install --locked bacon`.
